# Analyzing Factors Influencing Video Game Engagement

## Motivation
Understanding what keeps players engaged in video games is crucial for developers, marketers, and the gaming community. This project aims to uncover patterns and insights by analyzing factors such as game genres, user reviews, and playtime data. The findings will help identify what drives player retention and satisfaction, providing actionable insights for game development and marketing strategies.

## Data Source
The data for this project is collected from two main sources:
1. **Game Platforms**: Data on game details, user reviews, and playtime statistics.
2. **Review Aggregators**: User and critic reviews, including scores and textual feedback.

The data is collected using web scraping techniques and publicly available datasets. All data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and usability.

## Data Analysis
### Techniques Used
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
   - Standardize data formats and normalize numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualize distributions of playtime, review scores, and genres.
   - Identify trends and correlations between variables.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyze user reviews to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
   - Correlate sentiment with playtime and engagement metrics.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Build machine learning models to predict player engagement.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Stages of Analysis
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from relevant sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore the data to identify patterns and trends.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze textual reviews to gauge player sentiment.
5. **Modeling**: Develop and evaluate predictive models.
6. **Interpretation**: Draw insights and present findings.

## Findings
### Key Insights
1. **Genre Analysis**: Certain genres, such as multiplayer and role-playing games, show higher average playtimes and user satisfaction.
2. **Review Sentiments**: Positive reviews strongly correlate with longer playtime, while negative reviews often lead to lower engagement.
3. **Engagement Drivers**: Features like regular updates, community events, and high-quality graphics significantly influence player retention.

### Interesting Observations
- Games with higher critic scores do not always result in higher player engagement.
- User-generated content (e.g., mods) can significantly extend a game's lifespan and engagement.

## Limitations and Future Work
### Limitations
1. **Data Bias**: User reviews and playtime data may be influenced by individual preferences or regional trends.
2. **Incomplete Data**: Some datasets may have missing or incomplete information, affecting the analysis.
3. **Temporal Trends**: Gaming trends can change over time, and the analysis may not capture long-term patterns.

### Future Work
1. **Expand Data Sources**: Incorporate additional data, such as streaming statistics or social media discussions, to enrich the analysis.
2. **Advanced Techniques**: Apply deep learning models for sentiment analysis or time-series analysis for playtime trends.
3. **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Extend the analysis to include data from multiple gaming platforms for a broader perspective.
